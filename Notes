_ROUTE CONFIGURATION_
first thing first. i have seperated a components folder for handling routes anda screnns folder to hanlde what exaccty goes in the UI of each componenet.

//===============================================
// _ROUTE CONFIGURATION_
In the main.jsx i have used `createRouterBrowser` function to create routes. The `createroutesElements` function after that is used to create routes based on React Elements. its taking JSX elements to defining routes.

Inside `createRoutesFromElements`, there are two <Route> components defined:
The first <Route> is for the root path /, and it renders the App component.
Inside this first <Route>, there are two nested <Route> components:
One for the index page, with path='/' and HomeScreens component.
Another for the /login path, rendering the Loginscreen component.
Router Initialization: After setting up the router and routes, it initializes the router using createBrowserRouter and createRoutesFromElements.

Rendering: It then renders the root component <RouterProvider> provided by react-router-dom to ensure routing functionality is available throughout the app.

Strict Mode: The entire application is wrapped in React.StrictMode, which is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.

DOM Rendering: Finally, it renders the root component onto the DOM using ReactDOM.createRoot().

So thats does it for the Main.jsx for.Changes will be applied after application progesses.
